I taught this redesigned lecture a second time, with the added challenge of switching to remote instruction after midsemester due to COVID-19. A transnational history of the United States as told through the case study of California's rise from an elusive colonial possession on the eastern rim of the Pacific Basin to the fifth largest economy in the world in the past decade.
