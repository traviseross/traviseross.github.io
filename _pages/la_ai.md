Along with my colleagues and students at George Fox University, I am leading an initiative to integrate team- and project-based learning in computing into the liberal arts education, and especially the humanities. A liberal arts education has long proved robust and powerful because of the way it trains students to think critically, to solve problems creatively, and to read and write carefully. It rests on the time-tested axiom that college is best viewed as an opportunity to learn how to continue to learn anything&mdash;any subject, any skill&mdash;throughout life.

We do not see the digital world or the dawning age of AI as a threat to any of that. Instead, we see it as an imperative that we create new ways to teach students to think critically with AI and machine learning; a full liberal education has to include cutting-edge problem-solving tools! The nascent AI-boom has only made clearer how powerful and how necessary it is for us to provide future generations with a classical liberal education that approaches problems in thoroughly modern ways.

How do we do that? It remains an open question, but only because it cannot be curricularized from the top; it cannot be taught through a series of static courses. The liberal arts education has proved so robust precisely because it provides a platform for students to pursue their own education by following their curiosity and their passions. We are beginning to build a platform for students to discover and hone their aptitude for computer-assisted problem solving in pursuit of the same classical disciplines that have long motivated humans to grow intellectually: Philosophy, history, literature, theology, ethics, and the arts. Those disciplines will never be automated because they are inherently subjective and creative, critical disciplines that computers can increasingly approximate by mimicking human products. Educated humans will always be able to do more **on top** of whatever a computer model might generate. Planning for that future requires that we train the current generation how to do that carefully, critically, and ethically now.
