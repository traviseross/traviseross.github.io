I am an interdisciplinary scholar focused on knowledge and information systems, particularly during moments of rapid transformation due to novel market forces or technological advances. Whether in my first project about the for-profit research company that created the Bancroft Library or in my emerging second project about the computerization of the Veteran's Health Administration a century later, I use deeply contextualized historical case studies to investigate broader systemic changes in how we have&mdash;and have expected to&mdash;access and create, buy and sell, and store and use knowledge and information in moments that produced both at unprecedented scales.

 I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Yale Center for Medical Informatics](https://medicine.yale.edu/ycmi/) and a researcher at VA Connecticut's West Haven VA Medical Center. Prior to my current appointment, I was a lecturer in the [Department of History](https://history.yale.edu) at Yale.

I am a researcher, teacher, and public historian with a PhD in history from the [University of Utah](https://history.utah.edu). Originally from western Montana, I currently live with my wife and two children in New England.
