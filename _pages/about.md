I am a researcher, teacher, and public historian with a PhD in history from the University of Utah. Originally from western Montana, I currently live with my wife and two children in New England.

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Yale Center for Medical Informatics](https://medicine.yale.edu/ycmi/). Prior to my current appointment, I was a lecturer in the [Department of History](https://history.yale.edu) at Yale.
