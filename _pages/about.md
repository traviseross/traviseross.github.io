I am a historian focused on knowledge and information in the modern United States. I am especially interested in historical moments of rapid changes in how we create, disseminate, access, and utilize knowledge and information. My main research project examines the for-profit research company that wrote the first draft of western North American history and created what became Berkeley's Bancroft Library. More recently, I have examined the history of innovation in medical computing at the Veterans Administration. In both cases, I use deeply contextualized historical case studies to investigate broader systemic changes in how we have interacted with knowledge and information.

 I am currently Assistant Professor of History and Director of Humanities Plus at [George Fox University](https://www.georgefox.edu) in Newberg, Oregon. I was trained in informatics as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Yale Center for Medical Informatics](https://medicine.yale.edu/ycmi/) and the [PRIME Center at the West Haven VAMC](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/centers/prime/). I was previously a lecturer in the [Department of History](https://history.yale.edu) at Yale University.

I am a researcher, teacher, and public historian with a PhD in history from the [University of Utah](https://history.utah.edu). Originally from western Montana, I currently live with my wife and two children in McMinnville, Oregon.
