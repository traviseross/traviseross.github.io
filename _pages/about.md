 I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Yale Center for Medical Informatics](https://medicine.yale.edu/ycmi/) and the [West Haven VA Medical Center](https://www.connecticut.va.gov/). Prior to my current appointment, I was a lecturer in the [Department of History](https://history.yale.edu) at Yale.

I am a researcher, teacher, and public historian with a PhD in history from the [University of Utah](https://history.utah.edu). Originally from western Montana, I currently live with my wife and two children in New England.
