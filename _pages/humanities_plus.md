I am the founding director of Humanities Plus at George Fox University, which focuses on integrating applied computing skills into undergraduate research in the humanities. Why bring computing to the humanities? 

First, to provide clearer pathways from college to career. There were never very many jobs explicitly *for* English or history majors, but graduates from those disciplines have always gone on to do just about everything. <a href="https://www.amacad.org/publication/humanities-workforce-beyond" target="_blank">That has not changed</a>. It has, however, become less clear to incoming college students what a history major or an English major can do after graduation. Given the rising costs of higher education, students are increasingly choosing majors that *sound* more employable, whether or not they actually are. We think more students would major in the humanities if they could see visible pathways to career outcomes, so we decided to pave paths and add signage to trails beaten down by a generation of flexible, creative graduates who found their way from English majors into the growing technology space. That is important because humanities majors like literature or history are *only* not bodies of knowledge, they are disciplined ways of knowing and intervening in the world. They *train* important methods and skills primarily through undergraduate research; Humanities Plus merely adds skills like thinking programmatically and careful, critical reasoning with data analytics to a robust toolkit of skills and habits that will never become obsolete. 

Second, the humanities are a tremendous way to train students to *innovate* with technology. There are no toy problems in humanities computing; they are all major, novel problems. That would be a major disadvantage in the real world, which requires timely results in an efficient manner, or else it precludes pursuing the project at all. Our formational educational moments, however, are rarely efficient. Most involve iteratively failing a bit better over time. Completing a college major in the humanities requires the slow habituation of deep, powerful habits of the mind, but it also provides an opportunity to spend multiple years pursuing the same set of ideas in slightly different contexts. We become better writers by rewriting. We make better arguments by being corrected. That also gives us an opportunity to apply technologies in new and innovative ways as we try and fail to compute the nearly incomputable.

So how does it work? Humanities Plus is an innovative academic opportunity unique to George Fox, but rooted in the growing emphasis on informatics in higher education. Informatics focuses on the *application* of the core disciplines of information and computer science to problems in other domains. In this case, students acquire skills by taking a course or two in computer science or another appropriate discipline at George Fox, but then they do the hard work of applying that skill to two kinds of problems rooted in the humanities: 

1. Their own undergraduate research topics from their major courses
2. Large, shared projects undertaken in the lab for stakeholders internal and external to George Fox University.

Humanities Plus is highly flexible. I work with students to identify their intellectual interests, career goals, and aptitudes as they change and grow. Acquiring a technical skill and cracking major research questions in the humanities are both long, challenging processes that require faculty and peer mentorship and community. H+ creates the space to grow together through that long process, fulfilling our promise that students at George Fox University will "be known."

If you are a prospective student, a parent, another scholar, or anyone else with a question about H+, please feel free to contact me via email or drop by my office in Minthorn.
