I am the founding director of Humanities Plus at George Fox University, which focuses on integrating applied computing skills into undergraduate research in the humanities.

The technology economy moves quickly, placing a premium on those who can rapidly learn and utilize programming languages, implement software packages into new workflows, or manipulate and analyze datasets to transform data into useful information and actionable knowledge.

The humanities&mdash;like the universities that host them&mdash;move very slowly. That's a good thing. Slowly, creatively, and critically engaging with arts and culture, past and present, can train deep and powerful habits of the mind as well as invalabuable analytical methods communication skills. Those will never become obsolete. The humanities already do a great job training those ways of thinking and doing, though we often fail to acknowledge that, thinking about our disciplines in terms of their content&mdash;literature, history&mdash;rather than the skills and methods we use to engage with those subjects.

Built on the emerging metadiscipline of informatics, H+ provides students at George Fox University a visible, highly customizable pathway to integrate discrete computational or programmatic skills fully into their humanities education. Higher education has always been about learning how to learn rather than mastering content, and we've simply added skills in applied computing to the things a student might learn to do while they learn to think critically, read carefully, and communicate effectively in the humanities. But the humanities are of unique value, we think, because the skills they naturally train are among the most difficult to automate, and therefore to render obsolete. That also means that they provide fascinating challenges and opportunities to learn to think programmatically or to wrestle with what we can and cannot hope to learn through data science. 

As an optional way to pursue a slow, traditional major in the humanities at George Fox, H+ offers students preparing to work in the fast-paced digital economy an opportunity to wrestle slowly and creatively with the very difficult challenge of combing what computers do best&mdash;compute over datasets, recognize patterns, complete tasks reduntantly&mdash;with the workflows and methods that humans have long used to create new knowledge rigorously but also creatively.

Introduction to Computational Methods in the Humanities and the H+ Lab will be offered for the first time during the 2023&ndash;2024 academic year. If you are a prospective student, a parent, another scholar, or anyone else with a question about H+, please feel free to contact me via email.
