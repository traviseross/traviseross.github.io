I am the founding director of Humanities Plus at George Fox University, which focuses on integrating applied computing skills into undergraduate research in the humanities. Why bring computing to the humanities? 

First, to provide clearer pathways from college to career. There were never very many jobs explicitly *for* English or history majors, but graduates from those disciplines have always gone on to do just about everything. <a href="https://www.amacad.org/publication/humanities-workforce-beyond" target="_blank">That has not changed</a>. It has, however, become less clear to incoming college students what a history major or an English major can do after agraduation. Given the rising costs of higher education, students are increasingly choosing majors that *sound* more employable, whether or not they are.

Second, the humanities are a tremendous way to train students to *innovate* with technology. There are no toy problems in humanities computing; they are all major problems. That would be a major disadvantage in the real world, but it presents a powerful educational opportunity for Humanities Plus students. Completing a major in them requires the slow habituation of deep, powerful habits of the mind. These slow, accretive disciplines train invaluable skills in reading, writing, and analysis. Setting aside the value of the *content* of these majors, those skills and habits will never become obsolete, they will prove useful to graduates long after the hottest technologies of tomorrow are long forgotten.

So how does it work? Humanities Plus is an innovative academic opportunity unique to George Fox, but rooted in the growing emphasis on informatics in higher education. Informatics focuses on the *application* of the core disciplines of information and computer science to problems in other domains. In this case, students will acquire skills by taking a course or two in computer science or another appropriate discipline at George Fox, but then they do the hard work of applying that skill to two kinds of problems rooted in the humanities: 

1. Their own undergraduate research topics from their major courses
2. Large, shared projects undertaken in the lab for stakeholders internal and external to George Fox University.
