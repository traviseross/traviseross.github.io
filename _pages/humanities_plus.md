I am the founding director of Humanities Plus at George Fox University, which focuses on integrating applied computing skills training into undergraduate research in the humanities.

The technology economy famoulsly moves quickly, placing a premium on those who can learn and utilize programming languages, implement software packages into new workflows, or manipulate and analyze huge datasets to transform data into information and information into knowledge.

The humanities&mdash;like the universities that host them&mdash;moves very slowly. That's a good thing. Slowly, creatively, and critically engaging with the arts and culture, past and present, trains habits of the mind, analytical methods, and careful communication skills that will never become obsolete.

Built on the emerging metadiscipline of informatics, Humanities Plus provides students at George Fox University a visible, highly customizable pathway for students to integrate discrete computational or programmatic skills fully into their humanities education, providing an opportunity to acquire and to practice applying novel tools and skills that are driving technological advancement by solving small, difficult problems in disciplines that are famously difficult to compute over or to automate.
    
Introduction to Computational Methods in the Humanities and the H+ Lab will be offered for the first time during the 2023&ndash;2024 academic year. If you are a prospective student, a parent, another scholar, or anyone else with a question about H+, please feel free to contact me via email.
