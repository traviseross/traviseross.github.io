I am the founding director of Humanities Plus at George Fox University, which focuses on integrating applied computing skills into undergraduate research in the humanities. H+ has a simple goal: To ensure that any student who wants to major in the humanities at George Fox can do so while simultaneously preparing for exciting careers in the technology economy, which is especially important as more and more of the public and private sphere becomes technology-dependent.

The technology economy moves quickly, placing a premium on those who can rapidly learn and utilize programming languages, implement software packages into new workflows, or manipulate and analyze datasets to transform data into useful information and actionable knowledge. By contrast, the humanities and the universities that host them move very slowly. We think that glacial pace is a powerful educational asset for training skills and changing lives. Slowly, creatively, and critically engaging with arts and culture, past or present, builds deep and powerful habits of the mind that never become obsolete. The humanities already do a great job training those ways of thinking and doing as well as critical analysis and thoughtful, effective communication. Too often, we think about our disciplines in terms of their content&mdash;literature or history&mdash;rather than the skills and methods we use to engage with those subjects.

H+ provides students at George Fox University a visible opportunity to create their own pathways, integrate discrete computational or programmatic skills fully into their pursuit of traditional humanities majors. For all of our focus on content, college has always empowered students to learn *how to learn*. H+ adds skills in applied computing to the list of things a student might learn to do along with learning to think critically, to read carefully, and to communicate effectively in the humanities. But the humanities are of unique value, we think, because the skills they naturally train are among the most difficult to automate, impossible to render obsolete.

As an optional way to pursue a slow, traditional major in the humanities at George Fox, H+ offers students preparing to work in the fast-paced digital economy an opportunity to wrestle slowly and creatively with the very difficult challenge of combing what computers do best&mdash;compute over datasets, recognize patterns, complete tasks reduntantly&mdash;with the workflows and methods that humans have long used to create new knowledge rigorously but also creatively. 

The initial methods course&mdash;HPLS 290: Introduction to Computational Methods in the Humanities&mdash;and a project-based humanities lab available for variable credit&mdash;HPLS 265&mdash;will both be offered for the first time during the 2023&ndash;2024 academic year. 

If you are a prospective student, a parent, another scholar, or anyone else with a question about H+, please feel free to contact me via email.
