I am the founding director of Humanities Plus at George Fox University, which focuses on integrating applied computing skills into undergraduate research in the humanities. H+ has a simple goal: To ensure that any student who wants to major in the humanities at George Fox can do so while simultaneously preparing for exciting careers in the technology economy, which is especially important as more and more companies and public sector jobs become *de facto* technology jobs.

As an optional way to pursue a slow, traditional major in the humanities at George Fox, H+ offers students preparing to work in the fast-paced digital economy an opportunity to wrestle slowly and creatively with the very difficult challenge of combing what computers do best&mdash;compute over datasets, recognize patterns, complete tasks reduntantly&mdash;with the workflows and methods that humans have long used to create new knowledge rigorously but also creatively. 

Why major in the humanities? Because they are fun, fascinating disciplines. They are also among the most accessible majors for students from low-income backgrounds or who are the first in their families to attend college, like I was. Disciplines like history, literature, or theology also allow for the slow habituation of deep, powerful habits of the mind and the development of invaluable skills in reading, writing, and analysis that will prove useful to graduates in their personal lives and careers long after the hottest programming language of tomorrow as been forgotten. The humanities are also averse to programmatic automation and to compuatational analysis, which actually makes the work of applying computing to them and then integrating the results into knowledge gained through more traditional methods that much more powerful as a long-term and transformative educational experience.

The initial methods course&mdash;HPLS 290: Introduction to Computational Methods in the Humanities&mdash;and a project-based humanities lab available for variable credit&mdash;HPLS 265&mdash;will both be offered for the first time during the 2023&ndash;2024 academic year. 

If you are a prospective student, a parent, another scholar, or anyone else with a question about H+, please feel free to contact me via email.
